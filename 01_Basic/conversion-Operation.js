/**
 * null > 0: When comparing null with a number using the greater than (>) operator, null is treated as 0. Since 0 is not greater than 0, the result is false.
null == 0: Even though null behaves like 0 when compared with numeric values, the strict equality operator (===) considers null and 0 as different data types. Therefore, the result is false.
null < 0: Similar to the first case, null is treated as 0 when compared with a number using the less than (<) operator. Since 0 is not less than 0, the result is false.
null >= 0: Since null is treated as 0 when compared with numeric values, and 0 is greater than or equal to 0, the result is true.
null <= 0: Again, null is treated as 0 when compared with numeric values, and 0 is less than or equal to 0, so the result is true.
